          <h4>A. Terms of Service for Job Seekers</h4>
          <p>For purposes of this Section A of the Top Equator General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker. As a Job Seeker, you are permitted to use Top Equator’s Site and its content solely for non-commercial purposes. You further agree that the Terms of Service for All Users also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Job Seekers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Job Seekers will govern.

          </p>
       

          <h4>1. Job Ads or Job Listings</h4>
          <p>Top Equator may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through the Site’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job Ads on the Site is free for Job Seekers. The Site displays Job Ads based on a combination of compensation paid by employers to Top Equator and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on the Site. While Top Equator may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Top Equator job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising. 

            <br>
            Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Top Equator exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Top Equator has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site. For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Top Equator endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. If you leave the Top Equator Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. Top Equator has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site or your search result without any obligation to provide reasoning for removal or exclusion. You understand and agree that Top Equator has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads. We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Top Equator assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, or other information submitted by any Employer or other user.
<br>
When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking system, Top Equator may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as via Application Programming Interfaces (API), cookies, pixels and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about job listings you viewed and job applications you started and completed. An Employer who uses tracker functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. However, you acknowledge and agree that Top Equator has no control over such an Employer or its website. You agree to Top Equator’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality.
<br>
Top Equator may provide independent functionality to assist you. For example, Top Equator may provide search options to help you narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Top Equator, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads. Top Equator may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone. Top Equator may also promote Job Ads by select Employers on certain pages or websites dedicated to a specific topic, such as inclusive hiring, or military-friendly job posts. The placement of a Job Ad on a dedicated page or website is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes (for example gig economy postings are not necessarily limited to contractor status jobs and may also include engagements for employment relationships) or a representation regarding the attributes of an Employer. Top Equator does not guarantee that applying to jobs through a dedicated page or website will lead to a better job application experience, a job interview, or a job offer. The dedicated pages or website do not contain an exhaustive list of Job Ads, and no  inferences can be drawn with respect to Job Ads or Employers that are not displayed on dedicated pages. Top Equator may also provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device. Top Equator cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.


          </p>
       

          <h4>2. Resume and Profile</h4>
          <p>
            By creating a searchable resume through the Site (“Top Equator Resume”) or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Resume” or “Job Seeker Resume”), you are requesting and authorizing Top Equator to make available Your Resume to anyone accessing our Site, such as Employers that Top Equator believes may have an interest in Your Resume, users of Top Equator’s Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing, or anyone with access to the URL associated with your searchable resume. We offer you the option to make Your Resume searchable on the Site to help you find a job. You are responsible for keeping Your Resume accurate and up-to-date.
<br>
When you provide Your Resume on the Site, Your Resume is set to searchable on the Site (“Searchable”) by default. If you do not want Top Equator to make available Your Resume to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Top Equator Resume and uploaded file resume to not searchable on the Site (“Not Searchable”). Resumes that are not searchable on the Site are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has submitted an application or provided their resume. Applying to jobs or otherwise sharing Your Resume with Employers may result in Your Resume being copied and published even if it is set to Not Searchable. While you may change Your Resume privacy settings at any time, setting Your Resume to Not Searchable will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you. Resumes set to Searchable, including yours, can be copied by search engines and other third parties accessing the Site, who can then make those Resumes publicly available elsewhere. Top Equator does not  control such third parties. If Your Resume is copied in this manner, then setting it to Not Searchable on the Site will not affect those third parties or the copies they have made of Your Resume. Changes to Your Resume on the Site may or may not be reflected on copies made by third parties. If you do not want Your Resume to ever be publicly visible or copyable, you must keep it set to Not Searchable. Top Equator may set any Searchable resume to Non-Searchable, or otherwise make it unavailable, if it contains content prohibited by this Agreement or for any other reason in Top Equator’s sole discretion. Top Equator assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Resume, your information, or application information that you share with Employers or otherwise make public. You can read more about resume privacy here.
<br>
In the United States, Top Equator may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through our Top Equator Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help connect you to potential Employers about their Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information is not used for apply purposes. You may remove your publicly available information from our Top Equator Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this form.
<br>
As we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. For the purposes of the Terms, these phrases are synonymous with the previously employed terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable,’ respectively. These phrases are only a rephrasing for the purpose of enhancing user understanding, and they in no way alters the substantive rights, obligations, or protections provided under our Terms.
<br>
By creating or uploading Your Resume, you are requesting and authorizing Top Equator, or an Top Equator vendor, to review or scan Your Resume and provide you feedback (at Top Equator’s discretion), including suggested changes, other jobs you may consider applying to because your qualifications may match their requirements, and suggestions for additional information you may want to include with your application to a particular job. We may also provide you with feedback through additional resume review services, such as helping you understand how your resume may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume, or a personalized resume review video. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers. You agree that your use of any feedback or other information provided through resume review services is at your sole discretion. You are the only one responsible for deciding which jobs to apply to and what to include in your applications. Top Equator assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any provided feedback. Top Equator does not guarantee that any recommended jobs are suited for you.
<br>
By creating an Top Equator Resume or uploading a file resume on the Site, Top Equator may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of Your Resume. Top Equator may also highlight to you items in Your Resume that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Resume. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Top Equator highlights items or a Job Ad is shared with you, Top Equator assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Ads or highlights. By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Top Equator may convert your file resume to a different file type. It is your responsibility to review Your Resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Top Equator to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or Your Resume to be reflected. Top Equator assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Resume or other application information you post, send or receive through the Site.
<br>
If you have an Top Equator account, an Top Equator Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Top Equator may associate Your Resume data with your profile on the Site (“Top Equator Profile”). Your Top Equator Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account. This includes your Top Equator Resume, your scores on any Top Equator Assessments you may have taken, and any information that you choose to provide on the Site, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, qualifications, preferences, whether you are ready to work, or pay. As we continue to improve the Site, you may be presented with the option to apply for a role using your Top Equator Profile. Information in your Top Equator Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers. If you do not want Top Equator to make your Top Equator Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Top Equator Resume and uploaded file resume to Not Searchable or remove Your Resume. Your response to an Top Equator Assessment will be associated with your Top Equator Profile. You may choose whether your Top Equator Assessment response is available to Employers viewing your Top Equator Profile. You can enable the ready to work feature on your profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately. Top Equator may disable that feature from your profile after a certain time, but you can manually enable it again.
<br>
To mitigate fraud, Top Equator may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your email address and/or phone number, from Your Top Equator Profile, Your Resume, or application, and may substitute it with an alias. Top Equator makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Top Equator’s sole discretion. Top Equator may also mask some or all of the Employer’s contact information, or an Employer may choose to mask their contact information when they contact you. In either case, you agree to an Employer contacting you from a masked phone number or email, and that you may not be able to return their call unless they provide their real number to you. Top Equator reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Resume to Searchable, and may toggle a public resume to Not Searchable, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Top Equator’s discretion. Top Equator makes no guarantee that Your Resume will be shown to any particular Employer or that any portion of the Top Equator Resume database will be available to an Employer at any particular time.
<br>
In certain markets, Top Equator works with organizations who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. Notwithstanding the possible use of the term “partner” or “partnership,” Top Equator’s engagement with these organizations does not create or imply a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent relationship, or any other form of joint enterprise between the “partner” organization and Top Equator. In some instances, Top Equator shares limited information back to these organizations about Job Seekers if Job Seekers agree to such sharing. For example, confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Top Equator account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). These organizations may advertise their career services in partnership with Top Equator. Top Equator is not responsible for, and disclaims all responsibility and liability for the activities of these organizations and their career services. Top Equator does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, guidance or services you may receive from these third parties. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Top Equator will have no liability arising from any interactions you have with such a third party organization. 
<br>
In connection with Top Equator’s work with these organizations, Top Equator may offer Job Seekers opportunities to present particular skills and qualifications on their Resumes in connection with training programs or courses they have taken. Job Seekers are ultimately responsible for the contents of their Resumes or Profiles, as well as their job searches and applications. Top Equator assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Resume or application information that Job Seekers share with Employers or otherwise make public. Top Equator makes no guarantees regarding your job application experience, that your Resume will be shown to a particular Employer, that Employers will contact you, or that you will receive job interviews or job offers. 


          </p>
       

          <h4>3. Applying to Jobs Through the Site</h4>
          <p>Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions and assessments (“Top Equator Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.) and to Top Equator’s Privacy Policy (all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Top Equator”,  “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean  “Top Equator Apply.”). To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Top Equator in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Top Equator services.  Use of any automation, scripting, or bots to automate the Top Equator Apply process outside of Top Equator’s official vendors and tooling is prohibited. 
<br>
            Prior to submitting your application through Top Equator Apply, you will be given the opportunity to review the information. It is important that you review this information carefully, including all attached files, to ensure that what is being submitted is accurate and complete, and that you are applying to your desired Employer. You are solely responsible for the contents of the application that you submit, including all attached files. Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, interview material or otherwise), Top Equator does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information. If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer. Unsubscribing from calls from Employers through the Site does not apply to interviews you have already scheduled. If you require alternative methods for applying, you must approach the Employer directly to request such alternative method, as  Top Equator is not responsible for the Employer application process.
            <br>
            When you ask Top Equator to submit your application or other information through Top Equator Apply, you are sending Your Resume and application information to Top Equator, and you are requesting and authorizing Top Equator to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for the indicated Job Listing(s). You further agree to Top Equator’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. When you ask Top Equator to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Top Equator Apply or the Site’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Top Equator reserves the right to reformat such application or message. Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through the Site being processed and analyzed by Top Equator according to this Agreement and Top Equator’s Privacy Policy.
           <br> 
            You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Top Equator assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Top Equator into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Top Equator assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply to a job using Top Equator Apply, Top Equator will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent, which may include sending your application to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by the Employer. You agree that Employers can enable such service providers to access and manage their Top Equator accounts, including by connecting to and integrating with APIs provided or used by Top Equator. By applying for a job through the Site, you agree to Employer’s use of such service providers, and acknowledge that such use may involve an intermediary’s access to job applications sent to its Employer client. We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. Top Equator also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. Top Equator depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Top Equator with the correct destination for all applications, and we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers. If the electronic destination provided to Top Equator is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application. Further, Top Equator does not guarantee that its integrations or the interface will be error-free. However, Top Equator may alert you when any of the above events occur.
            <br>
            Job Ads may expire or otherwise be removed between the time you submit your application and the time it is received, in which cases your application will be void. Top Equator has no responsibility for expired or removed Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration or removal. Top Equator and its third party providers may store your application and related information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site. We also cannot vouch for  the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to ATSs. Third party sites, including ATSs used by Employers, may disclaim liability for technical malfunctions, including the failure in the delivery of applications. We are not responsible if an ATS rejects or fails to deliver an application to an Employer for any reason. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored by Top Equator on Top Equator’s or third party providers’ servers, do not use the Top Equator Apply or Top Equator relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through the Site. By using the Top Equator Apply system, you fully consent to the above.
            <br>
            By using the Site, you agree that Top Equator is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, requirements, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Top Equator does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Top Equator does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Employers are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar laws, anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and any applicable data protection or privacy laws. Employers are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You must contact the Employer if you require alternative methods of screening. Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer. Top Equator cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application. Employers may ask applicants to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability and/or veteran status along with their job applications. Some Employers are required by law to ask these questions and you may see these questions when applying to jobs on the the Site. That is a separate process from Top Equator’s collection of demographic data (see section 11, “Your Job Seeker Data,” below). Top Equator is not responsible for these questions. If you have questions or concerns about an Employer’s application materials, please contact the Employer directly or refer to their privacy policy. Top Equator does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Top Equator cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process. Top Equator recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution. Top Equator does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.
            <br>
            By using Top Equator Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Top Equator to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Top Equator has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. Top Equator may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Top Equator to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Top Equator their interest in your application. You acknowledge and agree that Top Equator has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on the Site within the time period selected by the Employer. Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Top Equator (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Top Equator Relay Service) are not visible to Top Equator, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. Top Equator assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Employer Assist notices.
            <br>
            By using Top Equator Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Top Equator to schedule interviews with Job Seekers who meet criteria (based on information the Job Seeker has provided to Top Equator, such as answers to screener questions, resume, and Top Equator Assessment Responses) that the Employers have selected, and based on the Employers’ availability. You agree that Top Equator has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the availability or criteria the Employer provided to Top Equator may not be accurate. Top Equator may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately your and the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time.
            <br>
            Top Equator may offer Employers functionality that groups applicants based on whether they meet or may meet Employers’ criteria, based on text in their resumes or answers to screener questions. In all cases, Employers can view any applicant at any time, and Top Equator makes no decisions about any applicant. You agree that such functionality does not constitute or contribute to a decision, and is not a substitute for human discretion and review. The Employer is solely responsible for its screening and hiring decisions.
            <br>
            When you search for jobs on the Top Equator Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, the Site may suggest information from your Top Equator profile to include in your application. It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.
            <br>
            For Job Seekers located in Japan, you acknowledge that when Top Equator is presented as Top Equator Agent (hereinafter referred to as “Top Equator Agent Japan”), Top Equator is acting as an employment placement business provider (as defined under applicable law). Top Equator Agent Japan offers the services in accordance with these terms and the rules set forth in its website. Top Equator Agent Japan will only send you Job Listings that Top Equator Agent Japan determines may be of interest to you. You may also end your relationship with Top Equator Agent Japan at any time.
            <br>
            You acknowledge that as part of its efforts to combat fraud and spam, Top Equator may require that users verify their email address. When you apply to a job through the Site, you agree that you may be required to verify your email address, and that failure to verify may lead to your application being rejected.
            
            </p>
       

          <h4>4. Job Matching and Recommended Jobs</h4>
          <p>Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as a Job Seeker and to Employers in various formats on the Site. For example, Top Equator may recommend Job Ads which are similar to jobs to which you recently applied, or recommend Resumes to Employers which match Job Ads they post. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
<br>
            To generate matches, Top Equator uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Your Resume, your application materials (including responses to screener questions), Top Equator Assessments, and your activity on the Site (such as searches you run and Job Ads you click on and apply to). You agree and consent that Top Equator may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Employers.
            <br>
            Top Equator may automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to apply to a job or the email that is associated with your Top Equator account.
            
            </p>
       

          <h4>B. Terms of Service for Employers</h4>
          <p>The following terms and conditions apply to all Employers and other users who access or use the Site as intended for individuals and/or organizations seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement. You further agree that the Terms of Service for All Users also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Employers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Employers will govern.
<br>
            For purposes of this Section B of the Top Equator General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as an Employer or other user as described above.
            
            </p>
       

          <h4>1. Employer Accounts</h4>
          <p>When you create an Top Equator account, a Company Page or post job listings advertising employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”) on the Site, whether as part of the Top Equator Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement (including the Data Processing Agreement ), the terms associated with any Top Equator service you are using, and all of Top Equator’s policies, including the Top Equator Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you.
<br>
            When you create an Top Equator account, Top Equator may require that you verify your identity. You may be presented with different options for verification, including through a third party service called ID.me. When you use ID.me, you are interacting directly with ID.me, and you share your identification and identity with ID.me directly. You agree that ID.me is solely responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of data you provide, and any legal obligations related to such activities, including the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers. Top Equator does not collect any biometric information or biometric identifiers, or receive any biometric information or biometric identifiers from ID.me.
           <br> 
            When you access or use the Site in your capacity as an employee or other representative of an Employer, or if you create an Top Equator account on behalf of an Employer, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Employer to this Agreement. When you create an account on behalf of an Employer, the account belongs to the Employer, and you acknowledge that any and all information that you provide Top Equator through the account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to the Employer. As part of this account you may have an individual profile (“Employer Profile”). Your Employer Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Account Settings” and “Employer Settings” section of the account.  
            <br>
            As an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use. Top Equator is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party. By registering for an Top Equator account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding account activity to your Top Equator account. If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms. Employers may request that Top Equator disable an account at any time by contacting the Employer Help Center. Please note that Top Equator may be required to preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law. Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Top Equator, they should follow the steps listed in the “Your Personal data rights” section of this Privacy Policy.
            <br>
            In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admins”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account. Admin(s) can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site, such as accessing account data, including candidate Personal Data, contained in the account of the user who initiated the invite, or purchasing services from Top Equator under such account. If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Top Equator that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Top Equator from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data, access to your account, and any purchases made under your account. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, such as: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may also have the ability to purchase Top Equator products under your account, and you agree that you are responsible for the payment of all such purchases made. If you accept another user’s invitation to link your Employer account to their Employer account, you acknowledge that any and all information about your activity in your Employer account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to all linked users. Administrators of Linked Accounts may retain certain information Linked Account users provide, such as an email address used to receive applications. Linked Account users will not be able to see your activity, such as your job searches, applications or preferences or your Top Equator Profile information, contained in your Job Seeker account.  You may visit your account settings at any time to unlink your account.  The Admin assigned to an Employer account may also unlink any user from that Employer account at any time, and may be notified if your Linked Account is used to login from too many devices.
            <br>
            If your Top Equator employer account has a credit card or other payment method on file, such as bank account information for Automatic Clearing House (“ACH”) payment, Top Equator may charge that payment method for any products or services you order and for any outstanding payments, including to correct billing errors.
            <br>
            You agree that Top Equator may send notices to Job Seekers informing them that an Employer account has been compromised, including if such account is associated with you. Top Equator cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Top Equator bears no responsibility for doing so. Top Equator makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
            <br>
            Top Equator may offer suggestions, recommendations, or information to users that may support or improve their experience on Top Equator Sites. You understand that these offerings are provided as a courtesy and without warranty, and your use of such information is at your sole discretion. As an Employer, you are responsible for your use of the Site and any tools offered therein, including your decisions regarding your job description, the requirements for your job, compliance with applicable laws, including relevant federal, state, and local laws related to job postings, and whom you interview or hire. Top Equator assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any information provided by Top Equator. Top Equator may limit your ability to post a job, or the visibility of your job, if it does not appear to indicate a salary above minimum wage, wage transparency laws, or does not comply with other applicable law; however Top Equator is not responsible for, and you are solely responsible for, compliance with minimum wage, local language and other legal requirements.
            <br>
            If you are an Top Equator agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Top Equator partnership program. Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Top Equator usage and engagement, measured by revenue. Top Equator’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Top Equator’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time. 
            <br>
            You agree that Top Equator is not responsible for maintaining or storing employment records, job application materials or data on your behalf, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements or other applicable law.
            
            </p>
       

          <h4>2. Employer Services Including Top Equator Apply and Screener Questions</h4>
          <p>You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Top Equator may activate its Top Equator Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seeker may indicate interest in Job Listings through Top Equator Apply, and that Top Equator will send applications to the email address you provide. You also agree that Top Equator may activate a chatbot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions. The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application. When you use Top Equator candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Top Equator Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Top Equator may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate. You agree that if you use such candidate management tools, Top Equator may assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information the candidate provides to Top Equator into one document or webpage. You further agree that Top Equator is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention, reporting requirements or other applicable law. By using these tools you consent to any information shared through the Site being processed and analyzed by Top Equator according to this Agreement and Top Equator’s Privacy Policy. Top Equator may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. Candidate Summaries may be provided by Top Equator for certain Job Seekers in the Candidate Details page. These Summaries are populated with information from the Job Seeker and information provided by you in the Job Description. Candidate Summaries are not a recommendation for employment. Employers agree to review the full application and not to use such summaries as the basis for employment decisions.  In a Candidate Summary or other product or service on the Site, you may see a verification of a Job Seeker’s skills, certifications, or other qualifications.  Top Equator does not guarantee the accuracy of such verifications or information, and you are solely responsible for verifying information on the Site.
<br>
Whether you are using the Site directly or any ATS you are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, criteria you set for inviting candidates to interview, Company Pages that you create, update, or manage, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Top Equator Apply or otherwise, and agree that Top Equator is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal. You agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable law for all content on the Site, including minimum wage requirements, wage transparency laws, or any other law. If you include voluntary self-identification questions for Job Seekers along with your application materials, you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws related to such questions, including the content and format of the questions and your use of the Job Seekers’ responses. You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements related to collecting and reporting demographic information about applicants.
<br>
If you close or change any Job Listings that you post, you agree to promptly update such Job Listings on the Site or otherwise notify Top Equator.  Top Equator may provide you with a mechanism for responding to requests for accommodations from Job Seekers. You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You are responsible for clearly indicating that reasonable accommodations are available, engaging with and responding to any requests for accommodation, and providing information about how to request an accommodation to Job Seekers.
<br>
You agree that Top Equator may reject or remove any Job Listing or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. For example, Top Equator may remove any Job Listing or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing, requirement, or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers or otherwise violates applicable law. You understand and agree that you are responsible for ensuring that your Job Listing requirements and criteria are job-related and in compliance with applicable law. Top Equator does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. You are solely responsible for checking your Employer dashboard to view job applications and other information. Any notifications, such as emails, you may receive about applications or other activities, are provided solely as a courtesy to you and you should not rely on them.
<br>
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable. If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, such as an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Top Equator’s relay functions, do not use the Top Equator relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via another method. When using the Top Equator Apply function, Top Equator will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Top Equator by you, however, Top Equator has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you. In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Top Equator for any damages resulting therefrom.
<br>
Should you post any Job Listings for Job Seekers in any country (including but not limited to Japan) where the cross-border transfer of personal data is regulated (such as requiring user consent), you warrant and agree that you will not cause or allow a cross-border transfer of personal data from the Site to you that violates or is contrary to the applicable data protection laws. For example, you will take such actions to ensure that any resultant job applications and other personal data to be sent or directed to your designated contact information (including an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by you) either through Top Equator Apply or other relay functions shall be accessed or received by you at your business location in such country.
<br>
When Job Seekers apply or RSVP to your Job Listing, Top Equator may give them the opportunity to provide certain demographic information to Top Equator, such as race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status, as well as whether they have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”). This Top Equator demographic data survey is separate from any voluntary self-identification questions provided by Employers. By using the Program, you agree that Top Equator may collect demographic data from Job Seekers applying to your Job Listing using Top Equator’s demographic survey, and that Top Equator may use information from that survey to evaluate and improve our products. You further agree that you as an Employer have no ability, right, or entitlement to view or access demographic data collected via the Top Equator demographic data survey pertaining to any Job Seeker or related to any employer by any means including civil discovery, subpoena, or any other legal process without their permission. You agree you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable nondiscrimination laws. Top Equator disclaims any warranty regarding the demographic composition of Job Seekers applying to any particular job.
<br>
When you use Top Equator Apply for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Top Equator may add functions into the corresponding Top Equator Apply emails. In addition, Top Equator may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. Top Equator may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Top Equator to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, such candidates will receive rejection notices and will be set to rejected in your candidate dashboard. You further acknowledge that Top Equator has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. When you use Top Equator’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected.” If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Top Equator has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.
<br>
Similarly, you may be given the option to use candidate management tools that schedule interviews on your behalf with Job Seekers who meet criteria you have selected. If you choose such option, Job Seekers will be scheduled for interviews and invited to interviews on your behalf via email based on whether information the Job Seeker has provided to Top Equator (e.g., answers to screener questions, resume, Top Equator Assessment Responses) matches criteria you have set. You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You further agree that Top Equator has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the information the Job Seeker provided to Top Equator may not be accurate. Top Equator may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time, and by scheduling such interviews, Top Equator does not warrant that a Job Seeker is qualified, meets the criteria the Employer has set, or that the information provided by the Job Seeker to Top Equator is accurate. Top Equator candidate management tools are intended to allow Employers to more efficiently connect with Job Seekers as they determine, and the sole responsibility for the content of any screener question, any decision to proceed or not proceed with interview or offers, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of candidate management tools is solely with the Employer. By using this and other candidate management tools, you acknowledge and agree that Top Equator is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers, and that Top Equator does not act as your employment agency by offering these candidate management tools.
<br>
Top Equator may highlight to Job Seekers qualifications required for your position in order to help the Job Seekers assess whether to apply for your role. Top Equator does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Top Equator know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing. You agree that Top Equator Apply and Top Equator’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Top Equator assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are your and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
<br>
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Top Equator to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Top Equator. You also agree that you are only asking Top Equator to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Top Equator will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. You consent to Top Equator listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Top Equator’s Privacy Policy, as well as to Top Equator providing the recording to third parties to aid in analysis or quality of the product. Top Equator disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
<br>
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Top Equator, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created or claimed by you, or any Job Listing, application materials, voluntary self-identification questions, or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you. Top Equator may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Top Equator’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Top Equator product, Top Equator reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Top Equator product as well as any other Top Equator product as set out in the IO for that product, including but not limited to those Top Equator products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Top Equator may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per the maximum interest permitted by law and (ii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Top Equator incurs collecting such late payments.
<br>
When you view, send, take action on, make a decision regarding, store, or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, applications, pre-recorded interviews, and messages) through or using the Site or any Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”), Top Equator may, for any purpose, use any data of such materials or action for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Top Equator product or service (including to provide better search results and other Job Listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. Top Equator may also inform the Job Seeker of your  actions or activity related to such materials through or using the Site or any ATS.  For example, Top Equator may notify the Job Seeker about your activity or action related to a Job Ad (such as pausing or closing it), or Job Seeker’s application or Resume (for example, that you viewed or responded to it, or that you made a decision with respect to it). Top Equator may inform Job Seekers about activities you take on the Site, for example, whether you are online, recently active, or active on the Site. You hereby consent to Top Equator informing the Job Seeker about such actions and activities.
<br>
Top Equator, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Top Equator” or “Verified”. Employers may also request that Top Equator add such labels. Top Equator shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are added or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Top Equator does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies.

          <h4>3. Job Match</h4>
          <p>Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as an Employer and to Job Seekers in various formats on the Site. For example, Top Equator may recommend Resumes which match Job Ads you have posted, or recommend Job Ads to Job Seekers which are similar to jobs to which they have recently applied. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
<br>
            To generate matches, Top Equator uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Resume, application materials (including responses to screener questions), Top Equator Assessments, and user activity on the Site (such as searches run and Job Ads clicked on and applied to). You agree and consent that Top Equator may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Job Seekers.
