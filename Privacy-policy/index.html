          <p>Our core mission is to help people get jobs, and help employers find great candidates. Since each of our Affiliates and Brands (as detailed in our HR Tech Privacy Center) shares this core mission, we developed a Privacy Center as a way of educating our users about our affiliates, and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users. You can find out more about how we share data between affiliates on our Privacy Center FAQ page.

          </p>
          <p>Top Equator values the trust our users and customers place in us when they give us access to their Personal Data. This Privacy Policy describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect that information.
<br>
We update our Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that our Privacy Policy continues to clearly explain how we collect and use personal and non-personal data. 


          </p>
<p>            Here’s a summary of key updates:
</p>

          <ul>

<li> We have made changes to the structure and layout of our Privacy Policy to make it easier to read and understand.</li>
<li>We have added more detail about the information we collect, how we use Personal Data, and the legal bases we rely upon to use Personal Data.</li>
<li>In April 2022, we added a section about the Act on Protection of Personal Information (“APPI”)  Privacy Compliance for Japan.</li>
<li>We have updated our Region-Specific information section to include more information regarding U.S. privacy laws, the Texas Data Privacy Security Act (TDPSA), California Privacy Rights Act (together with the California Consumer Privacy Act, “CCPA”), Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act.</li>
<li>We have updated our Region-Specific information section to include India’s  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (NO. 22 OF 2023)</li>

<p>
    We encourage you to review the “Last Updated” legend below to determine when it was last amended. Any changes to the Privacy Policy become effective on the “Last Updated” date indicated below. 
<br>
If Top Equator is going to use Personal Data collected through the Sites in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, then Top Equator will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on the applicable Sites for 30 days prior to such use or by other means as required by law.
<br>
Top Equator reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.


</p>

          </ul>
       

          <p>Our Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and disclose the Personal and Non-Personal Data we collect from and about you when you access or use our online and/or mobile websites, applications, services, and software, interactions with us on the phone or in person, or, where permitted by applicable law and in line with this Privacy Policy, that we obtain from publicly available sources or third-party sources.

            Our Sites (the “Sites”) covered by this Privacy Policy include the affiliated online and/or mobile websites, applications, services, and software of
            
            </p>
       
         <h4>Who is Responsible for Your Information
        </h4>

          <p>This section explains when Top Equator is a controller or a processor of your Personal Information, and which entity is responsible for your Personal Data. </p>
       
         <h4>For Job Seekers:

         </h4>

          <p>For certain processing, such as when the employer sets questions like screener questions or assessments, Top Equator can be a processor of your application materials submitted through Top Equator Apply and of your interview information when you participate in an interview hosted on Top Equator. 
            These data are controlled by the Employer to whom you are applying.<br>
            Top Equator is a controller of all other information that you provide in the course of your use of our Sites.
            </p>
       
         <h4>The Scope of Top Equator’s Privacy Policy</h4>

          <p>This Privacy Policy covers data that we collect through the Sites, directly from data subjects, or that we obtain from third parties. In cases where you follow a link to a third-party website, you are no longer covered by our Privacy Policy, and any data collection or processing activity that takes place on that website will be governed by that website’s own privacy policy. We only collect data on the Sites that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
<br>
            In accordance with our Terms, the Site is generally only for use by people aged 16 or over. However, some jurisdictions have different age restrictions, as outlined below. 
            
            </p>
            <p>
                In all jurisdictions, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult even if your age is above the Top Equator permitted use age for that jurisdiction. 
<br>
We adopt a range of measures to try to ensure that no information is knowingly solicited from individuals who do not meet the minimum age or any other applicable age requirements. <br>

If we learn that an individual who does not meet the minimum age requirement has used the Site or provided personal information through the Site, we will restrict access to, or close their account, and remove that information from our systems.
<br>
Applicants to internal jobs at Top Equator should reference the Recruitment Privacy Policy.
<br>
Current and former employees of Top Equator should reach out to their Human Resources partner to reference the Global Employee Privacy Notice.


            </p>
       
         <h4>Security</h4>

          <p>Top Equator uses reasonable security measures to help protect your personal data. Top Equator intends to make your experience as secure as possible by protecting personal data covered by this policy against loss, misuse, alteration, or unauthorized access. We perform regular vulnerability assessments of our systems and network to help protect your personal data. However, no method of transmission or method of electronic storage of information via the Internet can be 100% secure. For example, emails or other messages sent via your web browser, or resumes shared with employers may not be encrypted by the recipient. Where the security of your information is beyond our control, we cannot guarantee the privacy of such information.

          </p>
       
         <h4>Cookies and Tracking technologies
        </h4>

          <p>When you visit the Sites, download or install an Top Equator App, and in some of our advertisements on third party websites we use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies, for measurement services, better targeting advertisements, and for marketing purposes. Please see our Cookie Policy for further detailed information regarding our use of cookies including how you can control the use of these cookies via your browser settings, including, where you wish to opt-out of our use of unnecessary cookies.

          </p>
       
         <h4>Acquisitions and other reorganizations</h4>

          <p>Information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any change of ownership or control in Top Equator’s business (whether by merger, acquisition, sale, or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), and any such information may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy until you are otherwise notified. Equally, information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any acquisition or merger carried out by Top Equator of such third parties.
